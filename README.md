## 📖 Overview

**Resumind** is an AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions, assigns ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores, and provides tailored improvement suggestions — all **directly in the browser with no backend required**.  

This project showcases my ability to:  
- **Build modern, production-ready UIs** using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**  
- **Integrate AI capabilities** seamlessly with **Puter.js** (GPT, OCR, and storage)  
- **Manage global state** efficiently with **Zustand**  
- **Architect serverless applications** that scale and deploy instantly  
- **Deliver clean, responsive, and maintainable codebases** using Vite
